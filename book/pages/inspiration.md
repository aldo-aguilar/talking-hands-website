Talking Hands is the dream-sound-child of "rustic" augmented reality and 70's talk box technology. Ever since I heard Daft Punk's Discovery album I knew that I needed to get a piece of that technology in my mouth. Fast forward ~11 years and here I have the opportunity to build any instrument my imagination deemed necessary. I knew I needed to do something not only to satisfy this decade-old talkbox itch but also my new craving for unnecessary machine learning. This thing wasn’t going to come to fruition without some cheesy title that would make me giggle every time I heard it; thus the punny name “Talking Hands” emerged. Now my initial ideas about how to interface with a talk box using your hands had a lot of sensors, motion, and other ideas using electronics. However, I thought that it would be more accessible to write something that anyone with a webcam could interface with. I really enjoy machine learning, and computer vision is something I hadn’t built on-top of enough. Now we have a talkbox fully controlled using your webcam, no guitars needed.
